🎯 Personal Reflection

Working on this project was a major step in my web development journey.
It wasn’t just about styling elements  it helped me truly master how the box model and flexbox work in real world layouts.

I now understand how to control spacing, alignment, and structure precisely using these tools.
This project gave me the confidence to design more complex layouts from scratch and made me appreciate the importance of clean, organized CSS in front-end development.
